NAME
    POE::Component::Jabber - A POE Component for communicating over Jabber

SYNOPSIS
    POE::Component::Jabber is not meant to be used directly. Please use one
    of the subclasses of Client.

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::Jabber is a module that simplies for the POE developer,
    access to the Jabber protocol through the use of one of the four Client
    classes. With built in events for common Jabber packets, all a POE
    developer need do is provide an event and arguments for most events so
    the responses to the requests can be properly handled by the coder.

    Please see the Client classes for more detailed descriptions of the
    events provided.
